## 2025-05-15 - [XSS in Custom Markdown Renderer]
**Vulnerability:** The MarkdownPreview component was using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with raw user input processed through regexes, allowing for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
**Learning:** Custom markdown parsers that use string replacement to generate HTML must escape all HTML special characters in the input BEFORE applying any markdown rules. Additionally, links must be sanitized to prevent `javascript:` protocol exploits.
**Prevention:** Always escape user input when using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. For markdown-like features, implement a whitelist of allowed URL protocols and ensure all tags generated by the parser are controlled.
