## 2025-05-15 - [XSS in Custom Markdown Renderer]
**Vulnerability:** The MarkdownPreview component was using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with raw user input processed through regexes, allowing for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
**Learning:** Custom markdown parsers that use string replacement to generate HTML must escape all HTML special characters in the input BEFORE applying any markdown rules. Additionally, links must be sanitized to prevent `javascript:` protocol exploits.
**Prevention:** Always escape user input when using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. For markdown-like features, implement a whitelist of allowed URL protocols and ensure all tags generated by the parser are controlled.

## 2025-05-22 - [Insecure Randomness in Utility Tools]
**Vulnerability:** Tools designed for generating random numbers, strings, or UUIDs were using `Math.random()`, which is not cryptographically secure and can lead to predictable outputs.
**Learning:** Even if a tool is not explicitly labeled as "secure," users often expect utility generators (especially for UUIDs) to have high entropy and unpredictability. Relying on `Math.random()` in a security-conscious application is a risk.
**Prevention:** Always use `window.crypto.getRandomValues()` or `crypto.randomUUID()` for any random generation. When using `getRandomValues` for numbers, implement rejection sampling to avoid modulo bias.
